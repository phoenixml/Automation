Automating security tools
This Code was created by Brandon Perry i just use it for eductational purpuses i had to uploaded to a Git repo to use it later via docker container so i can pull it ;)
Feel free to learn C# and explore the power of API's and automating the security tools and run it in a different way rather than the traditional VM's. 

It's Docker and container's century enjoy!.
